# PrimesoftServer

This is a server application connected to a database in which insurance offers for relevant cars are located. Each car has an assigned owner. The application awaits the customer's inquiry who provides the id of the person for whom he wants to find offers. After submitting the request, it sends all the necessary information to the client and wait for the next request. The client application is in a separate repository - https://github.com/kuba1306/primesoftClient.
